Modern, lightweight WordPress framework for rapid plugin development with fluent builder APIs.

CI runs linting and compatibility sniffs across PHP 7.4–8.3 and WordPress 6.5+ so the framework stays aligned with its published requirements.

Run `composer check` locally to execute the same validation, lint, and compatibility sniffs before pushing.
